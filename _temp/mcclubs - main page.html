<h3>A few things to note...</h3>
<div class="mc_list">
<ul>
<!-- 	<li><strong>Sign up early:</strong> Many clubs "sell out" on the first day of enrollment. Last year, 75% of the enrollment occurred in the first day.</li>
	<li><strong>"Not available" message:</strong> If you get this message during check out, this means that the club has just sold out and we are working on updating the website to say "Class is full."</li> -->
	<li><strong>No late registration:</strong> Once registration closes, classes are finalized.</li>
	<li><strong>Enrollment Confirmation:</strong> Your email from Paypal, Subject: 'Receipt for Your Payment to McKenzie PTA' is your confirmation that your enrollment is complete and your registration was processed for the classes listed in the email.  <strong>If you do not receive the PayPal receipt, then your registration was not completed</strong>.</li>
	<li><strong>Class rosters: </strong>Rosters will be sent out shortly after registration closes. This communication will be sent to the address you entered in the first part of registration.</li>
	<li>Please note that McClubs start the following week after registration closes.</li>
