<div class="descriptions">Each fun session incorporates baseball games and instruction, brought to you by Illinois Baseball Academy's trained coaches. Children get exercise while learning the nuances of the game and spending time with friends. While being active is vital to maintaining balance in one's life, IBA is committed to helping parents and schools make a difference off the field as well. The curriculum stresses core ideals (i.e. Respect, Teamwork, Focus, etc.) that we hope will help your child meet life's challenges with confidence. Be a part of our team and enjoy baseball in a new way!
