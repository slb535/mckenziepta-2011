      <P align=center class=body style1>Our school is literally surrounded by gardens. In the 
        front are many small "island" gardens that are filled with plants donated from 
        McKenzie families. The entryway of the school was relandscaped in 2004 with many 
        beautiful perennials, shrubs and an enhanced walkway. On the south side of the 
        building is a nature habitat that was donated and constructed by local Boy 
        Scouts. But this web page is to let you know about McKenzie's learning gardens. 
        You can find the these gardens just outside the resource center behind the 
        school.&nbsp;</P>

      <P align=center class="style1"><SPAN class=body>The McButterfly garden, planted in 2002, is 
        against the west wall. It is a raised bed garden that was constructed and 
        planted by families and landscape committee members. This garden is dedicated to 
        Alex Dewey, a former McKenzie student . There is a plaque on the wall next to 
        the garden in his memory.</SPAN></P>

      <P align=center class=body style1>The Prairie Friendship garden was planted in 2004. The 
        garden was named by the graduating fourth grade class of that year. This class 
        made prairie themed note cards and sold them to raise funds for a bench that is 
        dedicated to Lindsay Mueller, also a former McKenzie student. There is a plaque 
        on the bench dedicated to her memory. Volunteers that planted this garden 
        included Lindsay's mother and friends, boy scouts, and landscape committee 
        volunteers. Both gardens were funded by the PTA, school gifts, classroom gifts 
        and a Gripp grant. Once again, we thank all involved in making these gardens a 
        reality.</P>
      <P align=center class="style1"><IMG height=227 alt="special features 4" 
src="pgarden1.jpg" width=343></P>
      <P align=center class="style1"><SPAN class=body>The purpose of these gardens is to provide a 
        place for students to come outside, enjoy the beauty of the plants, and learn 
        from nature. Science units that include ladybugs and butterflies or how plants 
        grow, Illinois history and prairie units, and various art projects are ideal for 
        using these gardens. All the plants were careful chosen to support these 
        curriculums. We also hope to implement a recess program where students can check 
        out art or gardening supplies and work in the gardens. </SPAN></P>

      <P align=center class="style1"><SPAN class=body>If you would like to volunteer in the gardens, or 
        have an idea to use, or improve the gardens please contact your PTA landscape 
        committee volunteer. We need you to keep our beautiful gardens alive and 
        growing! For more information about the gardens, a more extensive history of 
        them, or detailed layout and plant information, contact your child's teacher. 
        Each classroom has been provided with a booklet about each garden.</SPAN></P>
