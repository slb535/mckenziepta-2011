      <p align="left" class="general_body"><strong>What are LCD Projectors?</strong></p>
      <p align="left" class="general_body">An <strong>LCD projector</strong> is a video projector for displaying video, images or computer data on a  screen or any surface.  It is the modern  version of the slide projector or overhead projector.  It is typically installed on the ceiling of a  classroom.  In conjunction with an  interactive white board, it can project a virtual chalkboard, beam an  interactive globe and deliver interactive curriculum. </p>
      <p class="general_body"><strong>What are interactive white boards?</strong></p>
      <p class="general_body">An interactive white  board is a touch-sensitive display board that connects to a computer and  digital projector to show computer images.   Computer applications can be controlled directly from the interactive white  board and notes can be written on the board in digital ink and saved to share  or review later.  Interactive white  boards exponentially increase the capabilities of an LCD projector. </p>
      <p class="general_body"><strong>How will McKenzie students and teachers use  this technology?</strong></p>
      <p class="general_body">Interactive white boards combined with LCD  projectors allow teachers to illustrate curriculum information visually,  reinforce English vocabulary, and provide students with a variety of visual  media.  Teachers and students jointly  access and display websites, run educational software, run live video from a  camera, record, capture, highlight and review notes from a classroom discussion  and more.  One teacher from Kress, Texas  reported, “It has enabled me to move from the sage on the stage to the guide on  the side. Kids are in charge of the lessons; they are at the interactive  whiteboard actively constructing their knowledge.”  </p>
      <p class="general_body"><strong>How was the PTA able to fund the purchase of  interactive white boards and LCD projectors?</strong></p>
      <p class="general_body">The primary source  of funding is a result of restructuring the PTA Grocery Dollar program.  The changes in billing processes for the  Grocery Dollar program freed approximately $70,000 this fiscal year.  </p>
      <p class="general_body">In the former  Grocery Dollar process, McKenzie purchased all grocery dollars and collected  the funds approximately twenty days later.    Beginning this year, patrons are paying for grocery dollars prior to the  PTA purchasing them, thereby freeing these reserve dollars to be used more  effectively.</p>
      <p class="general_body">The secondary  source of funding is a result of a careful evaluation of PTA reserve  funds.  An official “reserve target” was  established this fiscal year.  The  Executive Board adopted the Illinois PTA Association recommendation of 50% of  the annual operating budget.   This  resulted in an additional $30,000 to put toward the technology initiative.</p>
      <p class="general_body"><strong>Why should we spend these funds this year?</strong></p>
      <p class="general_body">Per the National  PTA guidelines, “<em>As a rule, reserves should not exceed one-half of a PTA's budget for an  average year.  If it does, the indication  is that the PTA is not giving as much service to children and youth as it  should.&quot; </em>This  technology initiative was deemed the highest and best use of our available  funds on our school survey and from feedback from teachers, parents and  administrators.</p>
      <p class="general_body"><strong>Will we have enough money left over in our  budget to cover our other costs after this expenditure?</strong></p>
      <p class="general_body">Yes.  The available monies for the technology  project are separate from the funds allocated to cover our operating costs for  this years’ budget.  Additionally, we  have 50% of our annual operating budget in reserve.  </p>
      <p class="general_body"><strong>How was it decided that the PTA funds would  be spent on interactive white boards and LCD projectors?</strong></p>
      <p class="general_body">A thorough survey  and evaluation was completed in choosing the 2008-2009 class gift.   Please see the class gift update at <a href="school_gift.html">http://www.mckenziepta.com/Committee_Pages/school_gift.html </a>for more  details.   In the survey, it was clear  that technology was at the top of the list. Additionally, we heard from  teachers, administrators and parents about the importance of technology for 21st  century students.  At home and throughout  their lives, our children are accustomed to immediate access to electronic  inquiry and information.   Twenty first  century classrooms need to be equipped to teach children how to exist and  thrive in the “wired” world.</p>
      <p class="general_body"><strong>Who approved spending the PTA’s funds on  interactive white boards and LCD projectors?</strong></p>
      <p class="general_body">The PTA membership  at the March 10th meeting voted to approve the funding of the  interactive white boards and LCD projectors as it was clearly recognized as an  innovative, state-of-the-art tool to enhance 21st century learning.</p>
      <p class="general_body"><strong>Will McKenzie support and train teachers?</strong></p>
      <p class="general_body">Yes.  In fact, part of the purchase price includes  teacher training as well as the ability to call upon the manufacturer for help  as teachers integrate technology into their classrooms.   One of the advantages to deciding to  purchase the technology now is that Dr. Welter and District 39 can plan to  support the teachers with training and information over the summer and during  teacher in-service days throughout the next year.</p>
      <p class="general_body"><strong>When will they be installed?</strong></p>
      <p class="general_body">They will be  installed over the next five months, as the McKenzie School  schedule permits.  They will be ready for  use at the beginning of the 2009-2010 school year.</p>
      <p class="general_body"><strong>Who can I contact for further information?</strong></p>
    <p class="general_body">If you have further  questions, please contact McKenzie PTA President, Julie Johnson at  <a href="mailto:President@McKenziePTA.com">President@McKenziePTA.com</a>.</p>    </td>
