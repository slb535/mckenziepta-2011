            <p align="left">In an attempt to give all  children at McKenzie a chance to be part of McClubs, children will be allowed  to participate in only one McClub each session, unless extra space is  available.  If your child would like to  sign up for two clubs, please feel free to specify first choice.  A minimum number of participants is needed  for each McClub in order to establish the class.  If there are more registrations than spaces  in a McClub and your request cannot be satisfied, you will be notified by  phone, and your fees will be promptly returned. </p>
            <p align="left">No child will be excluded  because of inability to pay.   Scholarships are available through Dr. Welter (one scholarship per  student).  </p>
            <p align="left">In fairness to all  participants, McClub members must agree to follow the behavior guidelines as  established in the “Citizenship at McKenzie   School” pamphlet  distributed to all parents at the beginning of the year.  Parents will be notified if their child does  not adhere to these guidelines.  </p>
            <p align="left">Please fill out a separate  registration form for each child registering for each McClub.  <u><strong>We request a separate check for each  McClub requested.  </strong></u></p>
