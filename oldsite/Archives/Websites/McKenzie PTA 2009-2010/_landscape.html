      <P align=center class=style6 style8 style1>Our school is literally surrounded by gardens. In the 
        front are many small "island" gardens that are filled with plants donated from 
        McKenzie families. The entryway of the school was relandscaped in 2004 with many 
        beautiful perennials, shrubs and an enhanced walkway. On the south side of the 
        building is a nature habitat that was donated and constructed by local Boy 
        Scouts. But this web page is to let you know about McKenzie's learning gardens. 
        You can find the these gardens just outside the resource center behind the 
        school.</P>

                  Before school started in the fall, McKenzie’s schoolyard  was enhanced with a new three-bin composter.   The composter will enhance the curriculum by providing opportunities for  hands-on learning regarding soil, ecosystems, and conservation science.  In addition, by composting weeds and waste  from the butterfly and prairie gardens and the wildlife habitat and returning  the composted material to the soil, the McKenzie community can create its own  natural fertilizer, while reducing waste sent to landfills and reducing  emissions of greenhouse gases caused by transporting that waste.  </p>
                <p align="center" class="style1">            The  composter was built as an Eagle Project organized and led by Nick Bonamici, a  member of Wilmette Boy Scout Troop 5 and a 2002 graduate of McKenzie. Funding  for the project was obtained from the McKenzie PTA and a contribution from Home  Depot.</p>

            <P align=center class="style1">The McButterfly garden, planted in 2002, is 
              against the west wall. It is a raised bed garden that was constructed and 
              planted by families and landscape committee members. This garden is dedicated to 
              Alex Dewey, a former McKenzie student . There is a plaque on the wall next to 
              the garden in his memory.</P>

            <P align=center class=style1 style1>The Prairie Friendship garden was planted in 2004. The 
              garden was named by the graduating fourth grade class of that year. This class 
              made prairie themed note cards and sold them to raise funds for a bench that is 
              dedicated to Lindsay Mueller, also a former McKenzie student. There is a plaque 
              on the bench dedicated to her memory. Volunteers that planted this garden 
              included Lindsay's mother and friends, boy scouts, and landscape committee 
              volunteers. Both gardens were funded by the PTA, school gifts, classroom gifts 
              and a Gripp grant. Once again, we thank all involved in making these gardens a 
              reality.</P>
            <P align=center class="style1"><IMG height=227 alt="special features 4"

            <P align=center class="style1">The purpose of these gardens is to provide a 
              place for students to come outside, enjoy the beauty of the plants, and learn 
              from nature. Science units that include ladybugs and butterflies or how plants 
              grow, Illinois history and prairie units, and various art projects are ideal for 
              using these gardens. All the plants were careful chosen to support these 
              curriculums. We also hope to implement a recess program where students can check 
              out art or gardening supplies and work in the gardens. </P>

            <P align=center class="style1">If you would like to volunteer in the gardens, or 
              have an idea to use, or improve the gardens please contact your PTA landscape 
              committee volunteer. We need you to keep our beautiful gardens alive and 
              growing! For more information about the gardens, a more extensive history of 
              them, or detailed layout and plant information, contact your child's teacher. 
              Each classroom has been provided with a booklet about each garden.</P>
