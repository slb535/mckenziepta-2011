<h2>Food, glorious food</h2>

<p>Speaking of food, kids (and mom and dad) may want to leave a little room for Kim & Scott’s pretzels as they line up for the Variety Show. There’s nothing like a warm delicious pretzel and a bottle of water to pass the time as you wait to take your seat. Don’t forget to bring $2 for a pretzel and $1 for water with your tickets.
