          <p align="left" class="general_body_subheader"><strong>Helpful Hints  from Parents</strong></p>
          <p align="left" class="general_body">• Attend the PTA meetings. It’s a great way to get to  know other parents and be in the know on school happenings!</p>
          <p align="left" class="general_body">• Be sure to bookmark www.mckenziepta.com on your  computers and use the online calendar often when looking for event information.</p>
          <p align="left" class="general_body">• If you work outside the home be sure to look into  activities that go on after hours that you can participate in such as the Ice  Cream Social, which is on a Sunday afternoon, and Fall Frenzy, which is on a  Friday night, and the Variety Show, which rehearses at night.</p>
          <p align="left" class="general_body">• Volunteer, volunteer! This is a great community of  parents and children. You should get to know as many as you can.</p>
          <p align="left" class="general_body">• Be sure to purchase a directory at the opening day  coffee and consider getting one for your office and car as well. Some families  get one for each floor of the house!</p>
          <p align="left" class="general_body">• Hang around on the playground the first day of  school and check out the volunteer opportunities.</p>
          <p align="left" class="general_body">• Check out the websites now and then to keep up to  date with what is going on at McKenzie <a href="http://www.mckenziepta.com/">www.mckenziepta.com</a>, <a href="http://www.wilmette39.org/">www.wilmette39.org</a></p>
          <p align="left" class="general_body">• Check your child’s backpack EVERY DAY! There is  important Backpack Express and other info you don’t want to miss so be sure to READ  everything completely.</p>
          <p align="left" class="general_body">• Watch for the packet that comes home the first day  of school. There is information that you need to return the next day.</p>
          <p align="left" class="general_body">• If you have misplaced a flyer, check the flyer archive  and committee page. If you can’t find what you want on the website, just e-mail  “askcheetah@mckenziepta.com” This inquiry address is located under the Contact  Us tab on the PTA website.</p>
          <p align="left" class="general_body">• Be sure to check the menu if your child buys lunch.  There may be a day he/she would prefer you make a lunch instead!</p>
          <p align="left" class="general_body">• Sign up to serve lunch on occasion. It’s a great way  to put the faces with the names of the children your child is in class with.</p>
          <p align="left" class="general_body">• Order school supplies at the end of the year for  the next school year. It saves time and insures your child has everything they need.</p>
          <p align="left" class="general_body">• Watch for yearbook order forms in the fall.</p>
          <p align="left" class="general_body">• McClubs are after school programs sponsored by the  PTA and a ton of fun for the kids!</p>
          <p align="left" class="general_body">• An extra set of clothing is always wise to have in  their lockers, especially during the wet and cold winter months.</p>
          <p align="left" class="general_body">• Enjoy your time here, it goes by too quickly!</p>
