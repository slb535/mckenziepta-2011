            <p>Welcome to the Winter Session of McClubs, beginning January 24th and ending March 18th.  This session we are thrilled to provide a wide range of new clubs in addition to popular repeats.  A big thank you to the 100 parents who participated in the survey and voted for future McClubs.  You will see several of the ideas you voted for in this session's offering.   Other ideas are being evaluated for future sessions.&nbsp;Click <a href="descriptions.html">here</a> for detailed descriptions of the clubs as well as dates/times and eligible grades.

            <p class="style13"><strong>A few things to note...</strong>            
            <ul><li><strong>Sign up early:</strong>  Many clubs &quot;sell out&quot; on the first day of enrollment.  For the fall session, 75% of the enrollment occurred in the first day.</li> 
              <li><strong>&quot;Not available&quot; message:</strong>  If you get this message during check out, this means that the club has just sold out and we are working on updating website to say &quot;Class is full.&quot;</li>
              <li><strong>No late registration:</strong>  Once registration closes, classes are finalized.</li>
              <li><strong>Enrollment Confirmation:</strong> Your email from Paypal, Subject: 'Receipt for Your Payment to McKenzie PTA' is your confirmation that your enrollment is complete and your registration was processed for the classes listed in the email.</li>
