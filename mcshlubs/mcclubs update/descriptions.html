         Learning made fun! Come explore this exciting after-school program open to all 1st and 2nd graders who love to learn! <a href="http://www.myamazingminds.com" target="_blank">Amazing Minds</a> offers a variety of interactive topics that will expand your child’s knowledge of the world and reinforce their academic skills. This Fall’s topics are: Washington DC, Animal Kingdom, and Save the Earth. Past examples: math will become more than memorizing facts, as youngsters shop in a simulated grocery store. The mysteries of science will take on new meaning as children investigate owl pellets, perform experiments on rocks like real geologists or find out how to make raisins bounce! Reading and writing will become more natural, as children write about New York landmarks or take turns reading about rare Australian animals after a treasure hunt around the room! Finally, geography becomes more magical than a spot on the globe, as students excavate hidden treasures from an ancient Egyptian tomb, or sample ethnic cuisine from China or Italy.<br />

This lively form of dance encourages movement of all parts of the body giving it a good workout! The foot-tapping music, the eclectic beats makes for a great fun, a great workout! Try it first before the Park District offers this program in the winter. The dances are a fusion of traditional and classical Indian dances with the influence of some jazz, hip-hop and modern dance. There will be a choreography with mixed songs. Songs like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZzn2F3_FL0&amp;feature=player_embedded#" target="_blank">Jai Ho </a>(from the movie <em>Slumdog Millionaire</em>), Mambo jambo and little bit of Bhangra creates an eclectic mix of movements and variety. The last day of the class ends with a performance for the parents. The idea of the class is not only to learn a new art form, but also expose students to a new culture, music and language. We are currently running this program at Romona Elementary School in Wilmette and Levy Centre in Evanston.
