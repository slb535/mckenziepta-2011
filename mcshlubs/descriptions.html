Classes emphasize self-defense, goal setting and basic karate techniques. Karate also focuses on building character: developing concentration and listening skills, learning respect for others and improving self-esteem. Students leave with practical, confidence-boosting skills. The class is open to all skill levels; no previous experience required! Students do not need to wear the traditional karate Gi, just loose, comfortable clothes.
